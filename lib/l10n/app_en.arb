	"colosseumHistoryInfo2": "The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, and the arena was converted into a cemetery. \nThe numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century.",
	"colosseumConstructionInfo1": "Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69-79 CE) in 72 and was completed in 80 CE under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79-81). Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81-96).\nThe Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. The outer wall is estimated to have required over 3.5 million cubic feet of travertine stone which were set without mortar; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps.",

	"colosseumLocationInfo1": "Following the Great Fire of Rome in 64 CE, Emperor Nero seized much of the destroyed area to build his grandiose Domus Aurea (\"Golden House\").

	"colosseumLocationInfo2": "On the site of the lake, in the middle of the palace grounds, Emperor Vespasian would build the Colosseum as part of a Roman resurgence.",

The total length of all sections ever built is over 13,000 miles.",
	"greatWallHistoryInfo2": "Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BCE, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220-206  BCE), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. \nLater on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls.",
	"greatWallConstructionInfo1": "Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries.",
	"greatWallConstructionInfo2": "Stones cut into rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer brims, and gateways of the wall. \nUnder the rule of the Qing dynasty, China's borders extended beyond the walls and Mongolia was annexed into the empire, so construction was discontinued.",
	"greatWallLocationInfo1": "The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino-Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe.",
	"greatWallLocationInfo2": "Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.",

	"greatWall556ce": "The Bei Qi kingdom also launched several construction projects, utilizing over 1.8 million workers to repair and extend sections of the wall, adding to its length and even building a second inner wall around Shanxi.",
	"greatWall618ce": "The Great Wall was repaired during the Sui Dynasty and used to defend against Tujue attacks. Before and after the Sui Dynasty, the wall saw very little use and fell into disrepair.",

	"petraConstructionInfo1": "Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the \"Red Rose City\" because of the color of the stone from which it is carved.\nAnother thing Petra is known for is its Hellenistic (“Greek”) architecture. These influences can be seen in many of the facades at Petra and are a reflection of the cultures that the Nabataens traded with.",
	"petraConstructionInfo2": "The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos (“dome”) inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock of Petra at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury we see twin Greek Gods: Pollux, Castor, and Dioscuri, who protect travelers on their journeys. \nNear the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos.
